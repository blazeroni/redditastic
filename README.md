# redditastic

This is the source code for [redditastic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blazeroni.reddit.widget), a Reddit widget available on the Google play store.

### 

redditastic hasn't been updated in some time due to lack of free time to support it.  So, I'm releasing the code in the hopes others can get some use out it.  Feel free to use any or all of the code for your own project.  Integrate it into an existing app, or relaunch redditastic with a new name!

If you do happen to use the code, I'd love to hear about it!  No requirement to do so, though.

### State of the Code

This code was written before Android Studio existed (or at least before it was ready for regular use), so it still uses the old build system.  If you want to re-use the project directly, you'll likely want to update it to use gradle, etc.

Users can't login due to changes in the login process for third party Reddit apps.  That will need to be entirely re-implemented.

There isn't much code documentation to speak of.  If you have questions about a specific piece of code, feel free to contact me.
